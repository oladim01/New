    <div>There is no one in this world except you that makes me happy when they smile,</div>
    <div>And I'll do any thing to see it even if it means walking for 500 miles,</div>
    <br> 
    <div>I know I don't mean much to you but you're very important to me,</div>
    <div> And even if it's not been smooth sailing, it's clear for you to see,</div>
    <br>
    <div>For the best part of five years you were the person I had on my mind,</div>
    <div>And for most part of it, I wished we were closer than metal binds</div>
    <br>
    <div>Buh even though we weren't, there is no cause for sadness,</div>
    <div>Cos just seeing you happy filled me with happiness,</div>
    <br>
    <div>I feel there's no hope when it comes to you and I,</div>
    <div>But I have no regrets cos you made my life more worthwhile</div>
    <br>
    <div>So I'll wrap up with this, My One And Only Queen,continue to be the best that I know you to be,</div>
    <div>Cos I know you are Zainab, worthy for everyone to see </div>
    <br>
    <div>Happy Birthday once again Miss Zainab Abdulafeez Olaide,and may today be one of your best birthdays you have ever had.</div>
